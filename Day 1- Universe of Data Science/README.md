Hello guys my name is Sunil Kahalekar and welcome to the machine Learning Community series. This series is for everyone out there who are interested to learn data science machine learning. The real world applications and how they can basically Implement a basic to intermediate projects.

We are going to understand about the entire universe of data science. If tomorrow you become a data scientist or you become a data analyst you specifically go and

work in a data science projects.  We really need to know understand what is artificial intelligence, data science, machine learning and deep learning. How stats is basically getting used. One very important thing is that say most of the companies writer data science does multiple roles. He also works as a big data engineer sometimes he has to work as a machine learning engineer many more but if you go in very big product based companies every roles every person like machine learning

engineer has a separate roles and responsibility data scientists has a separate roles and responsibilities. So it is important to understand properly understand about the universe of data science. We are going to discuss about the basic differences between artificial intelligence, machine learning deep learning and data science. Let's call this universe as AI  so this universe is basically called as AI.

If I really want to understand the definition of AI it is basically to create an application which can perform which can perform its own task without any human intervention. This is the basic Definition of artificial intelligence.

 okay so the

specific thing which I have actually

written it Omega it is basically to

create an application which can perform

its own task without any human

intervention so for this specific thing

we call it as artificial intelligence

application

some of the coolest example which you

basically use

on to day-to-day basis right so the

first example that I would like to talk

about Netflix recommendation system

now whenever I talk about Netflix

recommendation system over here you will

be seeing that you know suppose let's

say you have seen some kind of action

movies right now whenever you see some

kind of action movies for a couple of

time then after that you get a

recommendation of action movies only

so this is one specific example with

respect to the recommendation one super

very simple example whenever we see in

this kind of situations

the second example and again Netflix has

an AI module which will specifically do

this recommendation system and it does

not require any human intervention

coming to the next example

self-driving car

I hope many of you have actually seen

this self-driving car so in self-driving

car also there is a specific AI module

which in turn will actually help the car

to be driven by itself without any human

intervention or also over there it will

be able to detect the objects that is

coming in front of them how it is

possible it is basically an AI model is

integrated in that specific car so these

are some of the examples even in

amazon.in if you probably go and do some

kind of shopping there also you get some

kind of amazing recommendation system

now coming to the next one I hope we are

very much clear with artificial

intelligence now let's go ahead and

let's discuss about the next one which

is basically called as machine learning

so if I talk about machine learning I

can definitely save machine learning is

a subset of AI and machine learning will

be falling somewhere inside this which

can be also called as it is a subset of

AI now what does machine learning is it

provides stats tool

stats tools analyze visualize

do some kind of prediction

or forecasting

not say or because

forecasting can also be one type of

functionality within this it can also

forecast

the specific data so here with the help

of various stats tools which we also say

it as machine learning algorithms which

we are probably going to see in this

specific course it utilizes all those

things to analyze the data visualize the

data to do some kind of predictions to

do some kind of forecasting of those

specific data right that is what machine

learning is all about and it is a subset

of AR whether you work as a machine

learning engineer as a whether you work

as a data scientist at the end of the

day you will be creating an AI

application okay now similarly

where does deep learning fall into it

then right so let's talk about deep

learning so deep learning is another

specific thing which is a subset of

machine learning so this is specifically

deep learning let's say I'm writing it

out over here deep learning

now in 1950s scientists thought that you

know the scientists were thinking

something much amazing during 1950s can

we train the machine also like how we

human being get strained right like

suppose if we are learning something how

do we learn those specific things right

so can we also make the machine learn in

a similar way like how we human being

learn so for that in short deep learning

was basically getting implemented to

mimic the human brain

okay

and here the main aim again let me

repeat it it was very simple we really

wanted to make the machine learn how

like how we human being would usually

learn things right so for this deep

learning was implemented and they used

something called as multi-layered neural

network okay multi-layered neural

network now with the help of this

multi-layer neural network we were able

to make the application learn like how

we human being learned specific things

so deep learning is again a subset of

machine learning okay but again at the

end of the day even though you are

working as a deep learning developer at

the end of the day you try to create an

AI application and that specific

application will be able to perform its

own task without any human intervention

now coming to the next one which is data

science right where does data science

fall into in this specific Universe

where does it fall like I have been

working for somewhere around seven to

eight years right in various Industries

in product based companies service based

companies right as a data scientist and

as a data scientist you should remember

that okay data scientists will probably

overlap each and everything over here

let's say they will be overlapping each

and every probably tomorrow you're given

a deep learning project you really need

to know deep learning projects at the

end of the day you should also be

knowing how to create an AI application

and over here you really need to use

maths statistics and many more things

that is the reason why I have actually

created this circle making sure that it

overlaps each and every sector right

even machine learning deep learning and

finally the AI path right so this part

is basically the data science in short

data science utilizes uh or is used in

every sector of this and over here again

summer overlapping will be doing with

respect to different different

techniques or tools or subjects that we

use like maths linear algebra stats

tools and not okay but in short here I

have given you the basic difference

between AI versus machine learning

versus deep learning versus data science

I hope you have understood in short

tomorrow if you're working as a data

scientist you may be given a task that

may be related to just edip engineering

it may be related to tasks that may be

related to deep learning or it may be

related to creating any kind of AI

application okay at the end of the day

any role that you fit in within this

specific divisions that I've actually

made you have to really create an AI

application at the end of the day uh so

yes in the next video we are going to

continue and understand about what is

the differences between supervised

non-supervised machine learning okay

which is a very important thing in both

machine learning and deep learning so

yes let's continue the next video
